# HR-Attrition

Context & Problem statement:

This is a fictional data set that contains atmost 30 features of categorical and discreet data. These data are kind of both numerical and text values which help in analysing the employee data from hiring to firing and on boarding to attrition. Dive into current available HR metrics to reduce the attrition rate and improve employee performance. Employee attrition has long been a significant worry for organizations due to the substantial investments of time, money, and effort in training new employees. When an employee departs, it results in overall losses for the company, including the cost of replacing and retraining, as well as disruptions in workflow. Moreover, attrition can erode trust among remaining employees, creating additional management challenges.
